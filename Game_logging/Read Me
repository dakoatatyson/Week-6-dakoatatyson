Questions for HW

I spent about 30 -40 hours trying to figure out that we needed to change the conf file in the pipline and 10 hours on the code its self. 

Using ht e logging in the python way was very straight forward.

The most frustrating was deffentily the index not showing up and the application wasn't sending logs because of the conf file in the pipeline.

I would like to learn how to use the visualiztion tools on Kibana.

That should add the pipline conf file part, that conf file needs to be the exact same as the one in the conf folder.
